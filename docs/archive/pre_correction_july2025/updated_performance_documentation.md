workbook = openpyxl.load_workbook(file_path, read_only=True, data_only=True)
worksheet = workbook.active
data = [row for row in worksheet.iter_rows(values_only=True)]
workbook.close()

# 2. Vectorized Preprocessing
numeric_data = df[numeric_columns].values.astype(float)
returns = np.diff(numeric_data, axis=1) / numeric_data[:, :-1]
returns = np.nan_to_num(returns, nan=0.0, posinf=0.0, neginf=0.0)

# 3. Memory Caching
cache_key = f"{file_path}_{os.path.getmtime(file_path)}"
if cache_key in self.dataset_cache:
    return self.dataset_cache[cache_key]

# 4. Sequential Algorithm Execution (Maintained)
for algorithm in algorithms:
