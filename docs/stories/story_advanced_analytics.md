# Story: Advanced Analytics Implementation (Post-MVP Candidate)

**As a** Portfolio Manager,
**I want** advanced analytics on optimization results,
**So that** I can understand performance drivers and risks.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

Implement the following analytics from the architecture diagram:
- **Performance Attribution**: Break down the portfolio's performance by individual strategy and by zone.
- **Sensitivity Analysis**: Analyze how the final portfolio changes as key parameters (e.g., correlation penalty) are varied.
- **Scenario Modeling**: Model the performance of the final portfolio under different, user-defined market scenarios.
- **Diversification Analysis**: Provide a detailed breakdown of the correlation structure of the final portfolio.

Each analysis must:
- Provide actionable insights for the user.
- Generate clear and informative visualizations.
- Be exportable to standard formats (CSV, JSON).
