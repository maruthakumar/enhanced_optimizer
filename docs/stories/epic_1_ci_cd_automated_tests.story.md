# Epic 1 Story: CI/CD & Automated Tests

## Status
In Progress

## Story
**As a** Development Team,
**I want** to implement a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline with automated testing,
**so that** the Parquet/Arrow/cuDF migration maintains code quality and prevents regressions during the HeavyDB replacement

## Acceptance Criteria

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
This story builds upon the Parquet/Arrow/cuDF migration epic (Epic 1) and provides essential quality assurance infrastructure:

**From Parquet/Arrow/cuDF Epic**: Need comprehensive testing for the HeavyDB replacement
**From Stories 1.1-1.4**: Existing algorithm implementations need regression testing
**From Architecture Migration**: Performance validation and accuracy preservation requirements

### Testing Architecture Requirements
**Current Testing Gaps**:
- No formal testing framework (no pytest, unittest)
- No CI/CD pipeline for quality assurance
- Manual testing with sample datasets only
- No performance regression detection

**Target Testing Infrastructure**:
```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml structure
name: Heavy Optimizer CI/CD
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  lint:
    - black --check
    - flake8 --max-line-length=88
    - mypy backend/
  test-cpu:
    - pytest backend/tests/ --cov=backend
  test-gpu:
    - pytest backend/tests/gpu/ --cov=backend
  integration:
    - pytest backend/tests/integration/
  performance:
    - python benchmark_regression_tests.py
```

### Test Data Requirements
**Sample Datasets for CI**:
- Small test dataset: 100 strategies × 10 days (fast CI execution)
- Medium dataset: 1,000 strategies × 30 days (integration testing)
- Large dataset subset: 10,000 strategies × 82 days (performance testing)
- Legacy CSV format samples for backward compatibility testing

### Quality Metrics Targets
**Code Coverage**: 80% minimum across all modules
**Test Performance**: <2 minutes for unit tests, <10 minutes for integration
**Accuracy Tolerance**: ±0.001% for fitness score comparisons
**Performance Regression**: <5% degradation allowed

### File Locations
**New CI/CD Components**:
- CI configuration: `/.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- Test configuration: `/backend/pytest.ini`
- Coverage configuration: `/backend/.coveragerc`
- Quality configuration: `/backend/setup.cfg` (flake8, mypy)

**New Test Suites**:
- Unit tests: `/backend/tests/unit/`
- Integration tests: `/backend/tests/integration/`
- GPU tests: `/backend/tests/gpu/`
- Performance tests: `/backend/tests/performance/`
- Regression tests: `/backend/tests/regression/`

**Test Data**:
- Sample datasets: `/backend/tests/data/`
- Expected outputs: `/backend/tests/expected/`
- Performance baselines: `/backend/tests/benchmarks/`

### Technical Constraints
**CI/CD Environment Requirements**:
- Python 3.10+ with CUDA 12.x support
- RAPIDS cuDF 24.x installation capability
- Sufficient GPU memory for testing (minimum 8GB recommended)
- Network access for dependency installation

**Compatibility Requirements**:
- Support both CPU-only and GPU-enabled testing environments
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing manual testing approaches
- Preserve existing CSV input/output formats for client compatibility
- Ensure no disruption to production job queue processing

**Security and Compliance**:
- No sensitive data in test datasets or CI logs
- Secure handling of test artifacts and reports
- Audit trail for all code quality decisions
- Compliance with existing production security requirements

### Performance Testing Strategy
**Baseline Establishment**:
```python
# Performance regression test structure
def test_algorithm_performance_regression():
    """Test that algorithm execution times don't regress beyond acceptable limits"""
    baseline_times = load_performance_baseline()
    current_times = benchmark_all_algorithms()
    
    for algorithm, current_time in current_times.items():
        baseline_time = baseline_times.get(algorithm, float('inf'))
        regression_threshold = baseline_time * 1.20  # 20% degradation allowed
        assert current_time <= regression_threshold, f"{algorithm} performance regression detected"
```

**Memory Usage Monitoring**:
```python
def test_gpu_memory_efficiency():
    """Ensure GPU memory usage doesn't exceed expected bounds"""
    max_memory_mb = 4096  # 4GB limit for CI environment
    actual_memory = run_cudf_workflow_with_monitoring()
    assert actual_memory <= max_memory_mb, f"GPU memory usage {actual_memory}MB exceeds limit"
```
