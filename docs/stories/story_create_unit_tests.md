# Story: Create a Comprehensive Test Suite for Logic Preservation

**As a** Developer,
**I want to** create a comprehensive suite of unit tests for the extracted ULTA, Correlation, Algorithm, and Zone-wise logic,
**So that** I can verify that the new, modular implementation preserves the behavior of the legacy script.

### Comparison Tests:

- Create a suite of tests that run on datasets of various sizes (small, medium, large).
- These tests should assert that the *behavior* of the new modules matches the legacy implementation (e.g., the same strategies are inverted, the same algorithm wins), not necessarily that the output is bit-for-bit identical.
- The tests should be run with different configuration files to ensure the system is properly configuration-driven.

### Functional Tests:

- Create specific tests to verify that the ULTA logic is working correctly.
- Create specific tests to verify that the correlation calculations are correct.
- Create specific tests to verify that the behavior of each of the 8 algorithms matches the legacy implementation.

### Edge Case Tests:

- Create tests that use empty datasets.
- Create tests that use a single trading strategy.
- Create tests that use a variety of portfolio sizes.
- Create tests that use different zone configurations.
