# Story 1.14: Architecture Migration Rollback Plan

## Status
To Do

## Story
**As a** DevOps Engineer,
**I want** a comprehensive rollback plan for the Parquet/Arrow/cuDF migration,
**so that** we can quickly revert to HeavyDB if critical issues arise in production

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Create automated rollback script that can restore HeavyDB workflow within 30 minutes
2. Implement feature flags to switch between HeavyDB and Parquet/Arrow/cuDF pipelines
3. Document step-by-step manual rollback procedures with validation checkpoints
4. Create data integrity validation to ensure no data loss during rollback
5. Test rollback procedure in staging environment with production-like data
6. Establish clear rollback decision criteria and escalation process

## Tasks / Subtasks

### Task 1: Feature Flag Implementation (AC: 2)
- [ ] Subtask 1.1: Design feature flag architecture

  - [ ] Add data migration if needed
  - [ ] Implement health checks post-rollback
- [ ] Subtask 2.2: Rollback validation
  - [ ] Create automated tests for rollback scenario
  - [ ] Verify all algorithms function after rollback
  - [ ] Test with various data states
  - [ ] Add rollback duration monitoring

### Task 3: Manual Procedures Documentation (AC: 3)
- [ ] Subtask 3.1: Create rollback runbook
  - [ ] Document pre-rollback checklist
  - [ ] Step-by-step rollback instructions
  - [ ] Configuration file modifications needed
  - [ ] Service restart procedures
- [ ] Subtask 3.2: Validation checkpoints
  - [ ] Define health check criteria
  - [ ] Create validation test suite
  - [ ] Document expected outputs
  - [ ] Add troubleshooting guide

### Task 4: Data Integrity Safeguards (AC: 4)
- [ ] Subtask 4.1: Implement data validation
  - [ ] Create checksum validation for inputs/outputs
  - [ ] Implement transaction logging
  - [ ] Add data snapshot capability
  - [ ] Create data comparison tools
- [ ] Subtask 4.2: Backup and recovery
  - [ ] Automate pre-migration backups
  - [ ] Create point-in-time recovery capability
  - [ ] Test data restoration procedures
  - [ ] Document data recovery timeline

### Task 5: Testing and Decision Framework (AC: 5, 6)
- [ ] Subtask 5.1: Staging environment testing
  - [ ] Execute full rollback in staging
  - [ ] Test with 25,544 strategy dataset
  - [ ] Simulate various failure scenarios
  - [ ] Measure rollback performance
- [ ] Subtask 5.2: Decision criteria documentation
  - [ ] Define critical failure thresholds
  - [ ] Create escalation matrix
  - [ ] Document rollback approval process
  - [ ] Establish communication plan

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
This story provides a safety net for the architecture migration from HeavyDB to Parquet/Arrow/cuDF. It should be implemented before fully deprecating HeavyDB (Story 1.13).

### Rollback Architecture
```python
# Feature flag implementation
class WorkflowFactory:
    @staticmethod
    def create_workflow(config):
        mode = config.get('ARCHITECTURE_MODE', 'parquet')
        if mode == 'heavydb':
            from csv_only_heavydb_workflow import HeavyDBWorkflow
            return HeavyDBWorkflow()
        else:
            from parquet_cudf_workflow import ParquetCuDFWorkflow
            return ParquetCuDFWorkflow()
```

### Rollback Decision Criteria
1. **Performance Degradation**: >50% slower than HeavyDB baseline
2. **Data Corruption**: Any data integrity failures
3. **Algorithm Failures**: >2 algorithms producing incorrect results
4. **Memory Issues**: OOM errors with standard datasets
5. **System Instability**: >3 crashes per day

### Rollback Timeline
- **Detection**: 0-15 minutes (automated monitoring)
- **Decision**: 15-30 minutes (escalation and approval)
- **Execution**: 30-60 minutes (rollback and validation)
- **Total RTO**: <90 minutes

### File Locations
**Rollback Components**:
- Rollback script: `/scripts/rollback_to_heavydb.sh`
- Feature flags: `/backend/lib/feature_flags.py`
- Rollback runbook: `/docs/ROLLBACK_PROCEDURES.md`
- Validation tests: `/backend/tests/rollback_validation/`

### Testing Requirements
- Test rollback with active jobs in progress
- Validate data consistency after rollback
- Test partial rollback scenarios
- Verify performance restoration
- Test under load conditions
