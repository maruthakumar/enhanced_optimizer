# Story: CSV Data Loading and Validation

**As a** Developer,
**I want to** implement efficient CSV data loading into HeavyDB with validation,
**So that** data integrity is maintained throughout the pipeline.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

1. **Efficient Loading**:
   - Stream large CSV files without loading entirely into memory.
   - Use batch inserts for optimal performance.
   - Provide progress tracking during the load.
   - Handle interrupted loads gracefully.

2. **Data Validation**:
   - Verify all numeric columns contain valid numbers.
   - Check for missing values and handle them per the configuration (e.g., fill with zero, drop row).
   - Validate date formats.
   - Ensure strategy names are unique.

3. **GPU Memory Transfer**:
   - Monitor GPU memory usage during the transfer.
   - Implement chunking if the dataset exceeds available VRAM.
   - Log the actual memory used (diagram shows 21.1GB target).
   - Implement a fallback strategy if GPU memory is insufficient.

4. **Performance Monitoring**:
   - Track and log the total load time.
   - Calculate and log the data throughput (MB/s).
   - Log peak memory usage.
   - Log any data quality issues discovered during validation.

**Technical Notes**:
- The architecture diagram shows "100% data integrity" as a key requirement.
- Must be able to handle the full data volume efficiently.
- Consider parallel loading strategies to improve performance.
- Maintain an audit trail of all loaded files.
