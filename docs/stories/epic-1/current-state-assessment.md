# Current State Assessment

## Existing Assets
- **Production Data**: 39.2MB CSV with 25,544 SENSEX strategies Ã— 82 trading days
- **Legacy System**: Zone-based optimizer (`Optimizer_New_patched.py`)
- **Algorithms**: 8 optimization algorithms (GA, SA, PSO, DE, ACO, HC, BO, RS)
- **Infrastructure**: Ubuntu server with Samba shares at `\\204.12.223.93\optimizer_share`

## Technical Debt Identified
1. **Simulation vs Reality**: Current benchmarks use simulated execution instead of real algorithms
2. **Hardcoded Values**: Fitness scores are predetermined rather than calculated
3. **Missing Integration**: Components exist but aren't properly integrated
4. **GPU Acceleration**: Transitioning to Parquet/Arrow/cuDF for production GPU support

## Architectural Strengths
- Well-designed component structure
- Professional reporting framework
- Comprehensive test coverage design
- Modular algorithm implementations
