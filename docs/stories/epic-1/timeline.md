# Timeline - STRATEGIC MIGRATION TO PARQUET/ARROW/CUDF

## Migration Context
Following the successful completion of Stories 1.1, 1.2, and 1.4, the platform has been updated to use a modern Parquet/Arrow/cuDF data stack. **Story 1.3 (HeavyDB Implementation) has been cancelled** and replaced with the Parquet/Arrow/cuDF migration approach for better scalability and performance.

- Parquet Implementation: `/docs/stories/epic_1_parquet_arrow_cudf.story.md`

## Revised Story Sequence (Post-Cancellation)
**Epic Structure**: 1.1 → 1.2 → ~~1.3~~ → 1.4 → **Phase 1: Parquet Migration**

### Phase 1: Parquet/Arrow/cuDF Implementation (Weeks 1-3)
**Priority**: HIGH - Core infrastructure migration
**Status**: 🎯 **IN PROGRESS**

1. **Week 1**: Dual-Write Infrastructure
   - ✅ Real algorithm implementation (Story 1.1)
   - ✅ Legacy system integration (Story 1.2) 
   - 📋 Parquet/Arrow/cuDF Implementation (Epic Story)
     - CSV → Parquet converter with schema optimization
     - Arrow memory pools for GPU transfers
     - cuDF GPU acceleration replacing HeavyDB

2. **Week 2**: Data Pipeline Migration
   - 📋 Replace HeavyDB connections with cuDF operations
   - 📋 Implement correlation calculations using cuDF
   - 📋 Validate results accuracy (±0.001% tolerance)

3. **Week 3**: Complete workflow integration (Story 1.4)
   - 📋 End-to-end workflow with Parquet/Arrow/cuDF
   - 📋 Performance validation (target: <3 seconds)
   - 📋 Production deployment preparation

### Cancelled Components
- ❌ **Story 1.3: HeavyDB Implementation** - Cancelled on 2025-08-02
  - Reason: HeavyDB determined to be prototype solution
  - Replacement: Parquet/Arrow/cuDF provides better scalability beyond 32GB limits
  - All GPU acceleration requirements addressed through new architecture

## Migration Phases Overview

### Phase 1: Dual-Write Implementation (Weeks 1-3)
**Zero-downtime migration with parallel data processing**
- Maintain existing workflow as primary
- Introduce Parquet/Arrow as secondary validation
- Comprehensive testing with production datasets

### Phase 2: Cut-Over Implementation (Weeks 4-6) 
**Gradual traffic migration with rollback capability**
- Progressive traffic routing: 10% → 50% → 90%
- Blue-Green deployment approach
- Continuous monitoring and validation

### Phase 3: Full Migration (Weeks 7-8)
**Complete transition and optimization**
- 100% traffic on Parquet/Arrow/cuDF
- Performance optimization and tuning
- Legacy system decommissioning

## Critical Path - UPDATED
**Post-HeavyDB cancellation critical path:**

1. ✅ Real algorithm implementation (Story 1.1) - **COMPLETED**
2. ✅ Legacy system integration (Story 1.2) - **COMPLETED**
3. 🎯 Parquet/Arrow/cuDF Implementation - **PHASE 1 IN PROGRESS**
4. 📋 Complete workflow integration (Story 1.4) - **PHASE 1 TARGET**
5. 📋 Production migration (Phases 2-3) - **WEEKS 4-8**
