# Story 1.2R: Legacy System Integration (Parquet/Arrow/cuDF Architecture)

## Status
✅ COMPLETED

## Story
**As a** System Developer,
**I want** to integrate the legacy optimizer system with the new Parquet/Arrow/cuDF pipeline,
**so that** we can validate our new implementation against proven results and ensure fitness calculation parity

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Execute legacy `Optimizer_New_patched.py` with production dataset and capture results
2. Execute new `parquet_cudf_workflow.py` with identical inputs and parameters
3. Fitness values must match within ±0.01% tolerance for all algorithms
4. Portfolio overlap must be >90% for top strategies (portfolio size 35-60)
5. Generate side-by-side comparison report with pass/fail validation
6. Document any acceptable differences (e.g., GPU vs CPU floating-point precision)

## Dev Notes

### Previous Implementation Context
Building on the work from Stories 1.1R and 1.4R, which provide the new Parquet/Arrow/cuDF implementation to compare against. The legacy system represents the proven baseline that our new architecture must match or exceed.

### Legacy System Details
**Location**: `/mnt/optimizer_share/zone_optimization_25_06_25/`
**Key Files**:
- Main script: `Optimizer_New_patched.py`
- Config files: `config_zone.ini`, `config_consol.ini`
- Output pattern: `/Output/run_*/optimization_summary_*.txt`

**Known Legacy Results**:
- Portfolio size 37: Best fitness 30.45764862187442 (SA algorithm)
- Proven reliable over multiple production runs
- Monolithic, file-based architecture

### Comparison Strategy
```python
# Comparison approach
legacy_results = execute_legacy_system(input_csv, portfolio_size)
new_results = execute_parquet_workflow(input_csv, portfolio_size)

comparison = {
    'fitness_match': abs(legacy_results.fitness - new_results.fitness) < 0.0001,
    'algorithm_match': legacy_results.best_algorithm == new_results.best_algorithm,
    'portfolio_overlap': calculate_overlap(legacy_results.portfolio, new_results.portfolio)
}
```

### Expected Differences
1. **Performance**: New system should be 10x faster
2. **Memory**: New system handles 100k+ strategies (vs legacy limit)
3. **Precision**: Minor floating-point differences due to GPU calculations
4. **Features**: New system has additional metrics (Sharpe, VaR, etc.)

### File Locations
**New Files**:
- Legacy wrapper: `/backend/legacy_system_wrapper.py`
- Comparison engine: `/backend/legacy_comparison.py`
- Report generator: `/backend/legacy_report_generator.py`

**Output Locations**:
- Comparison reports: `/output/legacy_comparison/`
- Visualization: `/output/legacy_comparison/charts/`
- Raw data: `/output/legacy_comparison/raw_results/`

### Technical Constraints
- Legacy system is Python 2.7 compatible (handle encoding issues)
- File-based communication (no direct API)
- Long execution times for large portfolios
- Memory constraints on legacy system

### Success Criteria
- Fitness values match within ±0.01% tolerance
- Same algorithms identified as best performers
- Portfolio overlap >80% for top strategies
- New system performance 10x faster minimum
