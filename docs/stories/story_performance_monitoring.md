# Story: System Performance Monitoring and Reporting

**As a** Developer,
**I want to** monitor and report system performance metrics,
**So that** we can track optimization efficiency and resource usage.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

Track and report the following:
- Execution times for each major component (Data Loading, ULTA, Correlation, each Algorithm).
- Memory usage (both RAM and GPU VRAM).
- CPU and GPU utilization percentages.
- Data throughput rates (e.g., MB/s for data loading).
- Algorithm convergence metrics over generations/iterations.

**Output**:
- Expose real-time metrics via the monitoring API.
- Include a performance summary section in the final execution report.
- Store historical performance data to track trends over time.
