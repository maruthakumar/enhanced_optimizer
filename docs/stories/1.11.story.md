## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
This story builds upon the single-GPU implementation from Story 1.5 (Parquet/Arrow/cuDF) and enables the platform to scale beyond 32GB memory limitations to process 100k+ strategies as specified in the PRD.

### Technical Architecture
```python
class MultiGPUOptimizer:
    def __init__(self, n_gpus=None):
        self.n_gpus = n_gpus or cuda.get_device_count()
        self.workers = []
        self.work_queue = mp.Queue()
        self.result_queue = mp.Queue()
        
    def distribute_work(self, data: pd.DataFrame, portfolio_size: int):
        # Partition data across GPUs
        chunks = self.partition_strategies(data, self.n_gpus)
        
        # Spawn GPU workers
        for gpu_id, chunk in enumerate(chunks):
            worker = GPUWorker(gpu_id, chunk, self.work_queue, self.result_queue)
            self.workers.append(worker)
            worker.start()
            
    def partition_strategies(self, data, n_partitions):
        # Smart partitioning based on correlation structure
        # Minimize cross-GPU communication
        return np.array_split(data.columns[1:], n_partitions)
```

### Memory Management Strategy
```python
# Per-GPU memory allocation
GPU_MEMORY_LIMITS = {
    'A100': 40 * 1024**3,  # 40GB
    'V100': 32 * 1024**3,  # 32GB
    'T4': 16 * 1024**3,    # 16GB
}

# Dynamic strategy allocation
strategies_per_gpu = min(
    available_gpu_memory / memory_per_strategy,
    total_strategies / n_gpus
)
```

### Configuration Schema
```ini
[MULTI_GPU]
enabled = true
n_gpus = auto  # auto-detect or specific number
gpu_memory_fraction = 0.9  # Reserve 10% for system
load_balance_interval = 1.0  # seconds
enable_peer_transfer = true

[SCALING]
min_strategies_per_gpu = 1000
max_strategies_per_gpu = 50000
enable_cpu_fallback = true
memory_spill_threshold = 0.85
```
