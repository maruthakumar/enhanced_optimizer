### Code Quality Assessment

#### Strengths
1. **Professional Implementation**: All financial formulas correctly implemented
2. **GPU Optimization**: Consistent GPU acceleration with CPU fallbacks
3. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive validation and edge case handling
4. **Documentation**: Clear docstrings and inline comments
5. **Modularity**: Clean separation of concerns across modules
6. **Configuration**: Flexible configuration system

#### Areas of Excellence

### Issues Found

#### Minor Observations
1. **Algorithm Integration**: While the enhanced fitness adapter exists, the 8 individual algorithms still use the base `FitnessCalculator` rather than `EnhancedFitnessAdapter`
2. **Configuration Default**: Production config defaults to `mode = legacy` rather than enhanced
3. **Kelly Integration**: Kelly sizing not directly integrated into algorithm capital allocation logic

#### Recommendations
1. Update algorithm implementations to use `EnhancedFitnessAdapter` when enhanced mode is enabled
2. Consider making enhanced mode the default after validation period
3. Add integration tests for each algorithm with enhanced fitness
