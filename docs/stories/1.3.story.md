## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.1:

- Performance baseline established without sleep simulations
- All 8 algorithms executing with real data

From Story 1.2:
- Legacy system integration completed for validation

### Data Models
```python
# HeavyDB Schema (tentative)
CREATE TABLE strategy_metrics (
    strategy_id INTEGER,
    date DATE,
    pnl DOUBLE,
    PRIMARY KEY (strategy_id, date)
);

CREATE TABLE correlation_cache (
    strategy1_id INTEGER,
    strategy2_id INTEGER,
    correlation DOUBLE,
    calculated_at TIMESTAMP,
    PRIMARY KEY (strategy1_id, strategy2_id)
);
```

### HeavyDB Connection Configuration
Based on the backtester environment setup (from HEAVYDB_CONNECTION_GUIDE.md):

**Production Server Configuration** (Updated 2025-07-31):
```bash
HEAVYDB_HOST="204.12.223.93"      # Updated production server IP
HEAVYDB_PORT="6274"                # Default port
HEAVYDB_USER="admin"               # Default user
HEAVYDB_PASSWORD=""                # Empty password for production
HEAVYDB_DATABASE="portfolio_optimizer"  # Production database
HEAVYDB_PROTOCOL="binary"          # Binary protocol for performance
```

**Free Tier License Configuration**:
- License JWT installed at `/opt/heavyai/heavyai.license`
- Valid until: 2026-05-06
- GPU Support: NVIDIA A100-SXM4-40GB (40GB VRAM)

- Chunked queries: `chunked_query(query_template: str, chunk_column: str, start_value, end_value, chunk_size=1000000) -> DataFrame`
- Data loader: `load_strategy_data(df: DataFrame) -> bool`
- Correlation calculator: `calculate_correlations_gpu(data: DataFrame) -> np.ndarray`
