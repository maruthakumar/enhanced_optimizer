## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
This story builds upon the Parquet/Arrow/cuDF migration epic (Epic 1) and provides essential quality assurance infrastructure:

**From Parquet/Arrow/cuDF Epic**: Need comprehensive testing for the HeavyDB replacement
**From Stories 1.1-1.4**: Existing algorithm implementations need regression testing
**From Architecture Migration**: Performance validation and accuracy preservation requirements

### Testing Architecture Requirements
**Current Testing Gaps**:
- No formal testing framework (no pytest, unittest)
- No CI/CD pipeline for quality assurance
- Manual testing with sample datasets only
- No performance regression detection

**Target Testing Infrastructure**:
```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml structure
name: Heavy Optimizer CI/CD
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  lint:
    - black --check
    - flake8 --max-line-length=88
    - mypy backend/
  test-cpu:
    - pytest backend/tests/ --cov=backend
  test-gpu:
    - pytest backend/tests/gpu/ --cov=backend
  integration:
    - pytest backend/tests/integration/
  performance:
    - python benchmark_regression_tests.py
```

### Test Data Requirements
**Sample Datasets for CI**:
- Small test dataset: 100 strategies × 10 days (fast CI execution)
- Medium dataset: 1,000 strategies × 30 days (integration testing)
- Large dataset subset: 10,000 strategies × 82 days (performance testing)
- Legacy CSV format samples for backward compatibility testing

### Quality Metrics Targets
**Code Coverage**: 80% minimum across all modules
**Test Performance**: <2 minutes for unit tests, <10 minutes for integration
**Accuracy Tolerance**: ±0.001% for fitness score comparisons
**Performance Regression**: <5% degradation allowed

### File Locations
**New CI/CD Components**:
- CI configuration: `/.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- Test configuration: `/backend/pytest.ini`
- Coverage configuration: `/backend/.coveragerc`
- Quality configuration: `/backend/setup.cfg` (flake8, mypy)

**New Test Suites**:

- Secure handling of test artifacts and reports
- Audit trail for all code quality decisions
- Compliance with existing production security requirements

### Performance Testing Strategy
**Baseline Establishment**:
```python
# Performance regression test structure
def test_algorithm_performance_regression():
    """Test that algorithm execution times don't regress beyond acceptable limits"""
    baseline_times = load_performance_baseline()
    current_times = benchmark_all_algorithms()
    
    for algorithm, current_time in current_times.items():
        baseline_time = baseline_times.get(algorithm, float('inf'))
        regression_threshold = baseline_time * 1.20  # 20% degradation allowed
        assert current_time <= regression_threshold, f"{algorithm} performance regression detected"
```

**Memory Usage Monitoring**:
```python
def test_gpu_memory_efficiency():
    """Ensure GPU memory usage doesn't exceed expected bounds"""
    max_memory_mb = 4096  # 4GB limit for CI environment
    actual_memory = run_cudf_workflow_with_monitoring()
    assert actual_memory <= max_memory_mb, f"GPU memory usage {actual_memory}MB exceeds limit"
```

**Critical Issues**: None identified

### Compliance Check
- ✅ **Production-Data-First**: No synthetic data generation
- ✅ **Data Security**: Complete anonymization implemented

### Final QA Verdict
**✅ TEST DATA INFRASTRUCTURE APPROVED**

The test data implementation successfully establishes a secure, production-based testing foundation for the CI/CD pipeline. While the full CI/CD story remains in progress, the critical test data infrastructure is now complete and ready for use. All anonymization scripts are functional, test data is properly secured, and CI/CD integration points are configured.

**Recommendations**:
1. Complete remaining CI/CD tasks using the new test data infrastructure
2. Run full pipeline validation with anonymized production data
3. Consider quarterly test data refresh process
4. Monitor for new edge cases in production data

**Next Steps**: Development team should use the anonymized test data for all unit and integration tests as the CI/CD implementation continues.
