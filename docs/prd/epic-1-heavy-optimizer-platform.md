# Epic: Heavy Optimizer Platform - Brownfield Modernization

**Epic ID**: HOP-001  
**Created**: July 31, 2025  
**Status**: In Progress  
**Business Value**: Transform legacy zone optimization into GPU-accelerated, enterprise-grade portfolio optimization platform

## Executive Summary

The Heavy Optimizer Platform is a brownfield modernization initiative transforming a legacy SENSEX portfolio optimization system into a modern, GPU-accelerated platform. The system processes 25,544+ trading strategies across 82 trading days, delivering optimized portfolios via Samba network shares to Windows clients.

## Current State Assessment

### Existing Assets
- **Production Data**: 39.2MB CSV with 25,544 SENSEX strategies √ó 82 trading days
- **Legacy System**: Zone-based optimizer (`Optimizer_New_patched.py`)
- **Algorithms**: 8 optimization algorithms (GA, SA, PSO, DE, ACO, HC, BO, RS)
- **Infrastructure**: Ubuntu server with Samba shares at `\\204.12.223.93\optimizer_share`

### Technical Debt Identified
1. **Simulation vs Reality**: Current benchmarks use simulated execution instead of real algorithms
2. **Hardcoded Values**: Fitness scores are predetermined rather than calculated
3. **Missing Integration**: Components exist but aren't properly integrated
4. **No Real HeavyDB**: GPU acceleration claims without actual implementation

### Architectural Strengths
- Well-designed component structure
- Professional reporting framework
