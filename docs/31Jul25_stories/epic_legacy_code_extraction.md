# Epic: Legacy Code Logic Extraction and Integration

**Goal**: To safely extract the core, proven optimization logic from the legacy `Optimizer_New_patched.py` script and integrate it into the new, modular, database-driven architecture, ensuring that the behavior and performance characteristics are preserved.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- All core logic (ULTA, Correlation, Algorithms, Zone-wise) is successfully extracted into its own set of modules.
- The extracted logic is covered by a comprehensive suite of unit tests that validate its correctness against the original implementation.
- The new modules are successfully integrated into the new Data Access Layer and Algorithm Runner components.
- The new, integrated system produces the same optimization results as the legacy script when given the same input data and configuration.

**Stories**:
- `story_extract_ulta_logic.md`
- `story_extract_correlation_logic.md`
- `story_extract_algorithm_logic.md`
- `story_extract_zone_logic.md`
- `story_create_unit_tests.md`
