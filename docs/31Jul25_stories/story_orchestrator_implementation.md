**As a** Developer,
**I want to** implement a Pipeline Orchestrator that manages the end-to-end data flow of the optimization pipeline,
**So that** the system can run automatically and reliably with minimal manual intervention.

### Critical Pipeline Sequence:

The orchestrator **must** enforce the following execution order:
1.  Load CSV to HeavyDB
2.  Validate Data
3.  Apply ULTA Transformation
4.  Compute Correlation Matrix
5.  Run 8 Optimization Algorithms
6.  Select Final Portfolio
7.  Calculate Final Metrics
8.  Generate All Output Files

### Configuration-Driven Execution:

- The orchestrator must read all operational parameters from the `.ini` configuration files.
- It must support different execution modes as defined in the config: `full`, `zone-wise`, and `dry-run`.
- The selection of which of the 8 algorithms to run must be controlled by the configuration file.

### Monitoring and Logging:

- The orchestrator must log the progress of the pipeline without using hardcoded expectations (e.g., log the actual step being performed).
- It must track and report the actual performance metrics achieved during the run.
- It must log the execution time for each major component of the pipeline (ULTA, Correlation, each algorithm, etc.).
