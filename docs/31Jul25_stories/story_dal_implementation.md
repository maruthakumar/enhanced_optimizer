# Story: Implement the Data Access Layer (DAL) for HeavyDB

**Status: ✅ COMPLETED**

**As a** Developer,
**I want to** implement a dedicated Data Access Layer (DAL) that abstracts all interactions with the HeavyDB database,
**So that** the rest of the application can interact with the database in a clean, consistent, and maintainable way.

### Core Methods Required:

- `load_csv_to_heavydb(filepath, table_name)`: Loads a CSV file into a specified HeavyDB table.
- `apply_ulta_transformation(table_name)`: Executes the ULTA logic on the specified table.
- `compute_correlation_matrix(table_name)`: Computes and returns the correlation matrix for the specified table.
- `get_strategy_subset(table_name, strategy_list)`: Returns a subset of the data for a given list of strategies.
- `execute_gpu_query(sql_query)`: Executes an arbitrary SQL query on the GPU.

### Dynamic Handling Requirements:

- The DAL must dynamically create the table schema based on the structure of the input CSV file.
- The column count and data types must be determined at runtime.
- Memory allocation for operations should be based on the actual size of the data being processed.

### Configuration-Driven Behavior:

- All database connection parameters (host, port, user, password) must be read from the configuration file.
- GPU memory limits and batch sizes for data loading must also be read from the configuration file.

## Implementation Details

**Completion Date:** 2025-07-30

The DAL has been fully implemented in `/mnt/optimizer_share/backend/dal/` with the following components:

### Implemented Files:
- `base_dal.py` - Abstract base class defining the DAL interface
- `heavydb_dal.py` - HeavyDB implementation with GPU acceleration support
- `csv_dal.py` - CSV-based fallback implementation for development/testing
- `dal_factory.py` - Factory pattern for creating appropriate DAL instances
- `README.md` - Comprehensive documentation
- `dal_usage_example.py` - Example usage patterns

### Key Features Implemented:
- ✅ All required core methods (load_csv_to_heavydb, apply_ulta_transformation, etc.)
- ✅ Dynamic table schema creation based on CSV structure
- ✅ Configuration-driven behavior from production_config.ini
- ✅ GPU acceleration support with automatic CPU fallback
- ✅ Context manager support for clean resource management
- ✅ Robust error handling and logging
- ✅ Factory pattern for automatic DAL selection (HeavyDB vs CSV)

### Additional Methods Implemented:
- `get_table_schema()` - Retrieve table structure information
- `create_dynamic_table()` - Create tables from DataFrames
- `get_table_row_count()` - Get row counts for validation
- `drop_table()` - Clean up temporary tables
- `supports_gpu` - Check GPU availability

### Configuration Integration:
The DAL successfully reads from `/mnt/optimizer_share/config/production_config.ini`:
- Database connection parameters from `[database]` section
- Performance settings from `[performance]` section
- DAL type selection from `[system]` section

### Testing:
- Unit tests available in `/backend/tests/test_dal.py`
- Both HeavyDB and CSV implementations fully tested
- Context manager usage patterns verified

The DAL implementation provides a clean abstraction layer that allows the Heavy Optimizer Platform to work with or without HeavyDB, ensuring system flexibility and maintainability.
