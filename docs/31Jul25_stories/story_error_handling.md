# Story: Comprehensive Error Handling and Recovery


**Status: âœ… COMPLETED**

**Completion Date**: 2025-07-30
**Implementation**: Full error handling system with all required features
- Checkpoint/restore capability implemented
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Email/Slack notifications
- Full context logging with stack traces
- Automated recovery procedures
- See Error_Handling_Implementation_Guide.md for details
**As an** Operator,
**I want** robust error handling and recovery mechanisms,
**So that** the system can handle failures gracefully without data loss.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Implement `try-catch` blocks at the boundaries of all major components.
- Create a checkpoint/restore capability that allows the pipeline to be resumed from the last successful step.
- Log all errors with the full context (e.g., stack trace, input parameters).
- Implement retry logic for transient failures, such as temporary network or database connection issues.
- Send notifications (e.g., email, Slack) for critical, unrecoverable errors.
- Provide clear, user-friendly error messages in the final output and logs.
- Support the ability to restart a failed job from its last checkpoint.
