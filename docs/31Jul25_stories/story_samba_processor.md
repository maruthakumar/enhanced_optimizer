**As a** System Administrator,
**I want to** implement a Samba job queue processor that monitors for new optimization requests,
**So that** Windows clients can submit jobs seamlessly through the existing share structure.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- The processor must monitor the `\\204.12.223.93\optimizer_share\input` directory for new job files.
- It must parse job configuration from the submitted files.
- It must queue jobs for processing by the Pipeline Orchestrator.
- It must move processed files to the appropriate `completed` or `failed` directories.
- It must maintain a status history for all submitted jobs.
- It must be able to handle concurrent job submissions gracefully.
