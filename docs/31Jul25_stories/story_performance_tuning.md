# Story: End-to-End Performance Tuning and Validation

**Status: ðŸš§ IN PROGRESS**

**As a** Performance Engineer,
**I want to** conduct a holistic, end-to-end performance tuning pass on the fully integrated pipeline,
**So that** the new system is demonstrably faster and more efficient than the legacy implementation.

**Production Data Specifications**:
- **Benchmark Dataset**: `input/Python_Multi_Consolidated_20250726_161921.csv`
- **File Size**: 39.2 MB (39,201,813 bytes)
- **Data Complexity**: 25,544 SENSEX trading strategies Ã— 82 trading days
- **Total Data Points**: 2,094,608 P&L values
- **Date Range**: January 4, 2024 to July 26, 2024
- **Strategy Variations**: Multiple Stop Loss (SL 7%-88%) and Take Profit (TP 32%-42%) configurations
- **Expected Processing Volume**: 14,388 strategies/second target performance

**Current Production Baseline Performance**:
- **Data Loading**: 39.2 MB file processing
- **Strategy Count**: 25,544 strategies for portfolio optimization
- **Trading Days**: 82 days of historical data
- **Memory Requirements**: ~175 MB peak memory usage
- **Expected Execution**: 1.22-1.78 seconds for full workflow
- **Throughput Target**: 14,388 strategies/second

**Acceptance Criteria**:

1.  **Benchmark Goal**: The final, tuned system must achieve **2x-5x faster** processing than legacy system when processing the full 25,544-strategy dataset from production data.

2.  **Bottleneck Identification**: Use Performance Monitoring tools to identify bottlenecks in:
    - Loading 39.2 MB production CSV file
    - Processing 25,544 strategy columns
    - Correlation analysis across 25,544Ã—25,544 strategy pairs
    - Algorithm execution on 2,094,608 data points
    - Output generation for production-scale results

3.  **Query Optimization**: Optimize HeavyDB queries for:
    - 25,544-column table operations
    - Date-based filtering across 82 trading days
    - Correlation matrix calculations for production strategy count
    - ULTA analysis on actual SENSEX strategy data

4.  **Data Transfer Optimization**: Minimize GPUâ†”CPU transfers for:
    - 39.2 MB initial data load
    - 25,544-strategy correlation calculations
    - Portfolio optimization across production dataset

5.  **Parallelism Tuning**: Optimize for production workload:
    - ThreadPoolExecutor configuration for 8 algorithms
    - Batch processing for 25,544 strategies
    - Memory management for 2,094,608 data points
    - Concurrent processing of SENSEX strategy variations

6.  **Performance Tuning Report**: Document production benchmarks:
    - Baseline: Legacy performance on 25,544-strategy dataset
    - Current: New system performance on production data
    - Bottlenecks: Specific issues with 39.2 MB file processing
    - Optimizations: Improvements for production-scale data
    - Final Metrics: Validated speedup on actual production workload

**Production Performance Targets**:
- **Data Load Time**: < 5 seconds for 39.2 MB file
- **Total Execution**: < 60 seconds for full 25,544-strategy optimization
- **Memory Usage**: < 500 MB for production dataset
- **Throughput**: > 400 strategies/second sustained processing
- **Success Rate**: 100% completion for production data complexity

**Technical Notes**:
- All testing must use actual production data with 25,544 strategies
- Performance metrics must reflect real SENSEX trading strategy processing
- Benchmarks must account for production data complexity and size
- Memory optimization critical for 2,094,608 data point operations
- GPU acceleration validation required for production-scale correlation analysis
