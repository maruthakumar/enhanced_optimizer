## Key Observations

1. **Core Functionality**: The system is operational with CSV-only workflow
2. **HeavyDB Integration**: All HeavyDB-related stories are still planned
3. **Testing Framework**: No formal testing framework established
4. **Architecture**: Modular design partially implemented, full DAL pending

## Next Priority Stories

1. **High Priority**:
   - Complete unit test coverage
   - Extract correlation logic
   - Implement zone optimization

2. **Medium Priority**:
   - Implement DAL for future HeavyDB integration
   - Create integration testing framework
   - Enhance performance monitoring

3. **Low Priority**:
   - Advanced analytics features
   - HeavyDB optimization (dependent on HeavyDB availability)
