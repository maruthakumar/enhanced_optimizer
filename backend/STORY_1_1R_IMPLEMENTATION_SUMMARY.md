## 🔧 Key Technical Achievements

### Data Type Flexibility
```python
# Now supports both formats:
result = algorithm.optimize(data=numpy_array, portfolio_size=35)  # Legacy
result = algorithm.optimize(data=cudf_dataframe, portfolio_size=35)  # New GPU
```

### Automatic Fitness Function Creation
```python
# Automatically detects data type and creates appropriate fitness function
fitness_calc = FitnessCalculator(use_gpu=True)
fitness_func = fitness_calc.create_fitness_function(data, 'auto')
```

### GPU-Ready Architecture
```python
# GPU acceleration when available, CPU fallback when not
algorithm = GeneticAlgorithm(use_gpu=True)  # Auto-detects cuDF availability
```

### Strategy Handling
```python
# Supports both integer indices (legacy) and string names (new)
portfolio = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]  # Legacy integer indices
portfolio = ['Strategy_001', 'Strategy_002', ...]  # New string names
```
